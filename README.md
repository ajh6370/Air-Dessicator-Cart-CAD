# Air-Dessicator-Cart-CAD


Mobile Cart used to be able to test and move electro optical equipment on a optical breadboard
without the need to keep moving the 350 pound breadboard...now you can just oush it.

The Box is ~almost airtight and was mounted with a n2 cannister to purge the box of air contaminants.
This was due to normal air skewing optical test data...the nitrogen was needed to get an environment 
similiar to what is observed in space.
